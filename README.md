ROS node for access to Basler camera via Pylon CBaslerUsbInstantCamera API. 

Supports *low-latency, high-speed, arbitrary framerate, free-running* mode.

This port works with ROS2.

Used with a dart daA1280-54uc camera as installed on a BFFT/digitalwerk ADAS model car and the [FH Wedel Autonomous Driving ros_adas2019](https://github.com/FHW-AutonomousDriving/ros_adas2019) package.
